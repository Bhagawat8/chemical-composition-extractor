# Chemical Composition Extraction from Material Certificates

A document intelligence pipeline that extracts chemical composition data and other information from PDFs using DeepSeek-OCR, a vision-language model optimized for document understanding.

---

## Introduction

Material certificates are critical documents in manufacturing and supply chain management. They contain chemical composition tables that define the exact elemental makeup of metal alloys like Ti-6Al-4V (Titanium Grade 5). Manually extracting this data is tedious, error-prone, and does not scale.

This project automates the entire extraction process. You give it a PDF, it returns a clean CSV with element symbols, values, units, and metadata. No templates. No manual intervention.

The core challenge was not just OCR, but understanding document structure. Traditional OCR tools like Tesseract can read text, but they cannot understand that "6.53 - 6.54" under "AL" in a table means Aluminum content is in that range. We needed something smarter.

After evaluating multiple approaches including Tesseract with layout analysis and various open-source alternatives, we settled on DeepSeek-OCR. It is a vision-language model that understands documents the way humans do: visually. It outputs structured markdown with tables intact, which makes parsing significantly easier.

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| GPU | 16GB VRAM (T4) | 24GB VRAM (A10G) |
| System RAM | 16GB | 32GB |
| Storage | 20GB free | SSD preferred |

**GPU is mandatory.** DeepSeek-OCR is a 7-billion parameter vision-language model. CPU inference takes 10+ minutes per page with vanilla attention algorithm, making it inefficient.

### Why Flash Attention is Default

We use Flash Attention 2.0 as the default attention mechanism for three reasons:

1. **Memory efficiency**: Flash Attention reduces VRAM usage by 2-4x compared to standard attention, allowing the 7B model to fit on 16GB GPUs
2. **Speed**: 2-3x faster inference on supported hardware (Ampere architecture and newer)
3. **No accuracy loss**: Flash Attention is mathematically equivalent to standard attention

Flash Attention requires CUDA-capable GPU. On unsupported hardware, the model falls back to standard attention but may run out of memory.

### Estimated Processing Cost (A10G GPU)

Based on testing with AWS g5.xlarge instance ($1.006/hour for A10G):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time per page | ~12-15 seconds |
| Pages per hour | ~240-300 |
| Cost per page | ~$0.003-0.004 |
| Cost per 100 pages | ~$0.35-0.40 |

Model loading takes ~30 seconds on first run. Subsequent pages process faster with cached model.

## Core Features and Implementation

### What This Pipeline Does

1. Takes any PDF file as input
2. Converts PDF pages to high-resolution images (400 DPI)
3. Automatically corrects image orientation using Tesseract OSD
4. Runs DeepSeek-OCR on each images individually to extract text with structure preserved
5. Merged the OCR extracted text of all images.
6. Parses the OCR output to identify chemical composition tables
7. Handles German number formats (comma as decimal separator) and other irregularity
8. Distinguishes between requirement values and actual test results
9. Exports clean CSV with element data and PDF's metadata

### Key Technical Decisions

**Why DeepSeek-OCR over Tesseract?**

Tesseract is excellent for clean, well-formatted text. But material certificates are messy. They have rotated pages, multi-column layouts, tables with merged cells, and stamps overlapping text. DeepSeek-OCR handles all of this because it processes the document as an image and understands layout contextually.

**Why Tesseract for Orientation Detection?**

DeepSeek-OCR expects correctly oriented images. Scanned certificates are often rotated 90 or 270 degrees. Tesseract OSD is fast and reliable for detecting rotation. We use it purely for orientation detection, not for OCR.

**Why 400 DPI?**

We tested 200, 300, and 400 DPI. At 200 DPI, small text became blurry and OCR accuracy dropped. At 400 DPI, we get consistently readable text without excessive file sizes.

**Handling German Number Formats**

European certificates often use German notation: `0,004` instead of `0.004`. The parser detects comma-period patterns and converts appropriately.

                    |   Output CSV     |
                    +------------------+
```

Each step has a single responsibility. If the CSV is wrong, check the parser. If parsing fails, check the OCR. If OCR is garbled, check orientation.

## Development Notes

This project started with Tesseract and OpenCV-based table detection. It worked for clean certificates but failed on rotated scans and unusual layouts.

The breakthrough came with vision-language models. DeepSeek-OCR understands documents visually and outputs structured markdown, making parsing straightforward.

Key debugging insight: `model.infer()` prints to stdout instead of returning results. Capturing stdout solved the "None return" problem that consumed hours of debugging.

Lesson learned: orientation matters more than resolution. A rotated high-res image produces worse OCR than a correctly oriented low-res image.
